# Project Overview


### Background
Alzheimer’s disease(AD) is one of the most serious diseases affecting the health of the elderly in the world [1]. It is a chronic neurological disease and 60% -70% of dementia is caused by it [2].
AD is characterized by pathological tissues in the brain surrounded by be-ta amyloid plaques [1]. The cause of AD is still controversial in the industry, but the current mainstream hypothesis is caused by the accumulation of be-ta amyloid variants. Recent years it is reported that a large amount of the risk is believed to be inheritary with many genes involved [3].
The apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype is one of the protein factors that includes three alleles (e2, e3, e4) that are located on chromosome 19q3.2.Along with female sex chromosome, it is one of the genetic risk factors for dementia and AD [4]. Previous researches show APOE4 carriers display more widespread brain glucose hypometabolism [5] and a more severe phenotype in regions vulnerable to AD pathology, including parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and cingulate areas [6].

### Motivation
Although APOE4 genotype and sex are well-established risk factors for AD, the effect of APOE4 genotype can be different for male and female. Previous researches on cross-sectional studies showed that APOE4 imposes a higher risk for AD in women than in men [13-15]. In experiments of diagnostic groups, they also found a pattern of effects whereby the adverse effect of APOE4 on brain structure/function manifests in men but not until clinical disease stages in women [16].
Combined with previous studies, we found out that limited researches have been conducted to study the potential direct relationship between female and male on APOE4. By studying relationship between them, better medicine interventions can be developed in a targeted manner. Hopefully, Our study could provide valuable indications to delay or prevent the progression of AD.

### Research Directions
Inspired by Yuan’s latest research on interaction of APOE genotype and sex [7], we aim to conduct our own research based on RNA sequencing(RNA-Seq) data set they provided. In particular, we want to find the difference of effect of APOE4 for male and female by performing differential gene expression analysis, enrichment analysis, gene ontology analysis and clustering.
